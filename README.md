# NBA_Season_2023_Dashboards
## Introduction
This is an assignment that i have done during the Business Analytics course at Cambrian College. The dashboards is a basic dashboards shows you the stats of 2 players and the whole season game.

## Difiiculty
Since the API have free users and subscription users, i have a limited version of the API but it is sufficient enough for me to make a dashboards for it. Another thing is that i could have use Plotly for the whole dashboard website instead of flask, but the class have a tight due dates so i have to use flask to speed it up.

## Solution
If i would have finish the dashboard again, i would have use Plotly for the dashboard for better visual and interaction. Second thing i would have change for it would be reorganize the design of the dashboards for better look and easy to visualize.

## Conclusion
The basic dashboards about NBA players i did in Business Analytics course at Cambrian College. Need to fix the interaction and visual for future viewers and users.
